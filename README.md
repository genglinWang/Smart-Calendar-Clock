# Smart-Calendar-Clock

This project is one part of Open-Innovation-1(开放性创新实践) for Chongxin Collage(崇新学堂), School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong university. I'm happy to provide my solution on how to establish and create a smart bluetooth calendar based on STC89C52 single-chip.

If you are interested, you can refer to [report.pdf](https://github.com/genglinWang/Smart-Calendar-Clock/blob/main/Report.pdf) for more details, and feel free to contact me and discuss about the project.
